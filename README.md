**Surok** is a Java web application for planning school schedules. It manages
school buildings, classrooms, classes, subjects, teachers, and class workloads,
and includes a catalog of federal curricula.

Install [Git] and [Docker Desktop] with Linux containers, or Docker Engine with
Compose v2.24+. Start Docker, then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eshabakhov/surok.git
cd surok
docker compose up --build
```

Open [Surok](http://localhost:19500/) and [create an account] for your school.
Docker builds the application and starts PostgreSQL with local defaults.

## Configuration

To customize the local setup, copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env` and
edit the settings you need, such as `APP_PORT` or the database credentials.
The same file lists OAuth, administrator, and monitoring settings.

To create the first administrator, set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_ENABLED=true` and fill
in `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME`, `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`, and
`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`. Run `docker compose up --build`, sign in
with those credentials, then set `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_ENABLED=false` for subsequent
starts. Administrators can manage schools and the federal curriculum catalog.

Run `docker compose down` to stop the local stack. Database data is preserved
in a Docker volume.

## Deployment

The [Build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) checks pull requests and
publishes images from `main` to GHCR with commit SHA and `latest` tags.
The [Deploy workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) deploys the image for a
successful build on `main`. To redeploy an existing image, run Deploy manually
with its full commit SHA in `revision`.

Production services are defined by the `production` profile in
[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml). Deployment configuration and required
GitHub secrets are listed in the Deploy workflow.

## How to contribute

Start with an [issue] describing the problem or proposed change. Work in a
separate branch and submit a pull request to `main` with a description of the
change and how you verified it.

For local checks, install [JDK 21], set `JAVA_HOME` to that installation, and
keep Docker running for the PostgreSQL tests. From the repository root, run:

```sh
./mvnw -ntp --batch-mode clean verify -Pqulice
```

Maven Wrapper downloads Maven; the build installs Node.js and npm, runs tests,
checks Java with Qulice, and lints JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. On Windows, use
`mvnw.cmd` instead of `./mvnw`.

To run a single test class:

```sh
./mvnw -Dtest=ClasspathSqlTest test
```

To run Java on your computer with PostgreSQL in Docker:

```sh
docker compose up -d postgres
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
```

The database defaults in [application.yml] match Compose. If you customize
database settings in `.env`, pass the same `DB_*` variables to Maven or your
IDE: Compose reads `.env`, while a direct Java launch uses its environment.
For local HTTP login, set `APP_SECURITY_SECURE_COOKIE=false`. Yandex login
requires real `YA_ID` and `YA_SECRET`; local defaults support password login.

Before launching `SurokApplication` from an IDE, run `./mvnw process-classes`
to generate build metadata and prepare templates in `target/classes`.

After editing the application, run `docker compose up --build` again to see
the changes. If a command fails, include the command and its log in the issue.
Pull requests run CI checks before review.
